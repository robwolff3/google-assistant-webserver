# Google Assistant Webserver in a Docker container

### March 25th 2020 - Update

I had issues with my project and starting fresh seemed to fix it.

- Pull the new container image version
- Recreate the Google Actions Project following googles new documentation https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/guides/service/python
- Once setup, authenticated and showing up in Google Assistant settings on my phone I had to join the new device to my home in the Google Home app. Then it picked up on my Device Address for broadcasts.

-------------------------------------------------

## What is this?

This is a emulated Google Assistant with a webserver attached to take commands over HTTP packaged in a Docker container. The container consists of the Google Assistant SDK, python scripts that provide the Flask REST API / OAuth authentication and modifications that base it from the Google Assistant library.

I did not write this code, I simply pulled pieces and modified them to work together. AndBobsYourUncle wrote Google Assistant webserver Hassio add-on which this is largely based on. Chocomega provided the modifications that based it off the Google Assistant libraries.

How does this differ from AndBobsYourUncle's [Google Assistant Webserver](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/community-hass-io-add-on-google-assistant-webserver-broadcast-messages-without-interrupting-music/37274)? This project is modified, running based on the Google Assistant libraries not the Google Assistant Service which allows for additional functionality such as remote media casting (Casting Spotify) [See the table here](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/community-hass-io-add-on-google-assistant-webserver-broadcast-messages-without-interrupting-music/37274/343). However this method requires a mic and speaker audio device or an emulated dummy on the host machine.

Interested in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) but never used it before? Checkout my blog post: [Docker In Your HomeLab - Getting Started](https://borked.io/2019/02/13/docker-in-your-homelab.html).

## Setup

* Prerequisite - Mic and speaker audio device configured on the host machine. [Michal_Ciemiega](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/google-assistant-webserver-in-a-docker-container/88820/17?u=robwolff3) pointed out that a real soundcard is not necessary with: `sudo modprobe snd-dummy`. If you're not sure or need help you can follow [Googles Configure and Test the Audio documentation](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/guides/library/python/embed/audio?hardware=ubuntu).
1. Go the **_Configure a Developer Project and Account Settings_** page of the **_Embed the Google Assistant_** procedure in the [Library docs](https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/guides/library/python/embed/config-dev-project-and-account).
2. Follow the steps through to **_Register the Device Model_** and take note of the project id and the device model id.
3. **_Download OAuth 2.0 Credentials_** file, rename it to `client_secret.json`, create a configuration directory `/home/$USER/docker/config/gawebserver/config` and move the file there.
4. Create an additional folder `/home/$USER/docker/config/gawebserver/assistant` the Google Assistant SDK will cache files here that need to persist through container recreation.
5. In a Docker configuration below, fill out the `DEVICE_MODEL_ID` and `PROJECT_ID` environment variables with the values from previous steps. Lastly change the volume to mount your config and assistant directories to `/config` and `/root/.config/google-assistant-library/assistant`

## First Run

* Start the container using Docker Run or Docker Compose. It will start listening on ports 9324 and 5000. Browse to the container on port 9324 (`http://containerip:9324`) where you will see **_Get token from google: Authentication_**. 
* Follow the URL, authenticate with Google, return the string from Google to the container web page and click connect. _The page will error out and that is normal_, the container is now up and running.
* To get broadcast messages working an address needs to be set, the same as your other broadcast devices. In the Google Home app go to **_Account > Settings > Assistant_**. At the bottom select your ga-webserver and set the applicable address. There you can also set the default audio and video casting devices.

### Docker Run

```bash
$ docker run -d --name=gawebserver \
    --restart on-failure \
    -v /home/$USER/docker/config/gawebserver/config:/config \
    -v /home/$USER/docker/config/gawebserver/assistant:/root/.config/google-assistant-library/assistant \
    -p 9324:9324 \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    -e CLIENT_SECRET=client_secret.json \
    -e DEVICE_MODEL_ID=device_model_id \
    -e PROJECT_ID=project_id \
    -e PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8 \
    --device /dev/snd:/dev/snd:rwm \
    robwolff3/ga-webserver
```

### Docker Compose

```yml
version: "3.7"
services:
  gawebserver:
    container_name: gawebserver
    image: robwolff3/ga-webserver
    restart: on-failure
    volumes:
      - /home/$USER/docker/config/gawebserver/config:/config
      - /home/$USER/docker/config/gawebserver/assistant:/root/.config/google-assistant-library/assistant
    ports:
      - 9324:9324
      - 5000:5000
    environment:
      - CLIENT_SECRET=client_secret.json
      - DEVICE_MODEL_ID=device_model_id
      - PROJECT_ID=project_id
      - PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
    devices:
      - "/dev/snd:/dev/snd:rwm"
```

## Test it

* Test out your newly created ga-webserver by sending it a command through your web browser.
* Send a command `http://containerip:5000/command?message=Play Careless Whisper by George Michael on Kitchen Stereo` 
* Broadcast a message `http://containerip:5000/broadcast_message?message=Alexa order 500 pool noodles`

Not sure why a command isn't working? See what happened in your [Google Account Activity](https://myactivity.google.com/item?restrict=assist&embedded=1&utm_source=opa&utm_medium=er&utm_campaign=) or under **_My Activity_** in the Google Home App.

## Home Assistant

Here is an example how I use the ga-webserver in [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) to broadcast over my Google Assistants when my dishwasher has finished.

#### configuration.yaml

```yml
notify:
  - name: ga_broadcast
    platform: rest
    resource: http://containerip:5000/broadcast_message
  - name: ga_command
    platform: rest
    resource: http://containerip:5000/command
```

#### automations.yaml

```yml
  - alias: Broadcast the dishwasher has finished
    initial_state: True
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: input_select.dishwasher_status
        to: 'Off'
    action:
      - service: notify.ga_broadcast
        data:
          message: "The Dishwasher has finished."
```

## Known Issues and Troubleshooting

* _There are duplicate devices in the Google Home app_ - This happens every time the container is recreated, it looses its `device_id` stored in the container. This is fixed with my add step 4 under Setup. Once the container stores its new `device_id` there it will persist through container recreation.
* Error: _UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character_ - [zewelor](https://github.com/robwolff3/google-assistant-webserver/issues/1) discovered this issue of a Wrong UTF8 encoding setting in the locale env. He solved this by adding the environment variable `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` to the Docker configuration.
* If it was working and then all the sudden stopped then you may need to re-authenticate. Stop the container, delete the `access_token.json` file from the configuration directory, repeat the **First Run** procedure above.
* Having other problems? Check the container logs: `docker logs -f gawebserver`
